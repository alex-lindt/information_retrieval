    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Why is stemming necessary, in particular for IR?\n",
    "    - Stemming is the process of reducing inflected and derived forms of a word to a common basic form. This is done by using a set of fixed rules (for example always removing the ending -ings) and applying it to all words of all documents. This way, we can identify documents with similar content that only used different word forms. To exemplify, we can find that documents that contain the words \"democratic\", \"democracy\" or \"democratization\" are all relevant for a query that contains the word \"democrat\". This can help to increase the recall of our search.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Is there any setting (domain, scenario, etc) in which stemming can hurt performance? Illustrate with an example\n",
    "    - When we perform stemming we perform a generalisation of words, which implicitly means that we might decrease our precision. Consider for example the case that we have a query containing the word \"withing\". When our stemming algorithm removes the ending \"-ing\" whenever present, we will now find all documents that contain the word \"with\" to be relevant. Similarily, think of the words \"experiment\" and \"experience\", who might both be stemmend to \"experi\" and therefore wrongly associated."

    "- Another processing step (not done here) is to use n-grams. Illustrate why you would want to use n-grams in IR with an example.  \n",
    "    - Currently, we represent every documement as a bag-of-words which means that we completely disregard the word order. This is different when using a n-gram language model, where we represent the document as a bag of sequences of length n. By doing so, we implicitly model more context and will most likely end up with a more expressive representation of the document's content. Consequently, we can find documents that contain phrases from the query. Croft et al. give the example of the query \"black sea\". Clearly, documents that contain \"black sea\" are more likely to be relevant to our query than documents containing the words \"black\"and \"sea\" individually.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Usage of n-grams exacerbates some problems ex. in bi-gram language models. What is this problem? Suggest one solution \n",
    "    - The impact of phrases on the relevance of documents might not always be as clear as in the \"black sea\" example. For example when we consider the query \"art supplies\", a  document that does not contain the exact query but the words \"art\"/\"arts\"/\"artist\"/\"supplies\"/\"supply\"/etc. individually might be very relevant. A possible solution would be to consider both bigrams and single stemmed words contained in documents and then weight the occurences against each other to obtain an overall relevance ranking.\n",

    "    Assuming the dictionary is maps from document id to tokens in the document, we have to access the dictionary multiple times. We would have a total complexity of $O(D\\cdot n)$ where $D$ is the number of documents and $n$ is the average length of a word list associated with a document. This is because searching a list of length $n$ is in $O(n)$, assuming the list is not ordered. We have to search the token list for each document.  Note that the average runtime of this could be reduced in practice if the list of words associated with a document was in alphabetical order.\n",

    "    - If we have an inverted index, the time complexity of retrieving a document list for a query is independent of the number of documents, but instead it dependents on the query length. We would need to access the index dictionary $|q|$ times, i.e. we have $O(|q|)$ (note that we do not account here for having to calculate the intersection between all retrieved document id lists). This reduces the time complexity compared to the {document-> token} dictonary a lot, since the query length is usually much smaller than the number of documents.\n",

    "- For a large enough collection, we cannot store an index in memory. How is this tackled in practice (briefly explain)? Comment on the time complexity. \n",
    "    - If the inverted index is too big for our runtime memory, we can make use of merging. Instead of having one index, we write multiple partial indices to the disk. At retrieval time we load one index after the other and store the partial result, and then we merge all partial results together. Regarding time complexity, this does only add a merging operation in the end, which can happen in $O($*total number of retrived document ids*$)$ using the python *set* function.\n",
    "    \n",

It is helpful in finding relevant documents because it allows us to distinguish documents that focus on a specific topic from those who just briefly mention it. As an example, we can think of the query \"Spaghetti Carbonara\". A document that describes how to make the dish is very likely to repeat both words multiple times whereas some document about planning your vacation in Italy might address in one sentence a restaurant where a nice Spaghetti Carbonara can be found.

    "    - The number of occurences of a word within a document (i.e. the *word count / term-frequency*) is on its own not a reliable measure of how representative the word is for the document's content. This is because even after removing very common stop words like 'a'/'the'/etc. , there are still words that occur more often within written language than others. One way to deal with this problem would be to binarize the term-frequency (i.e. set 1 for occurence and 0 for non-occurence). However, this way we completely disregard how often a term occurs within a document, which is an indicator of how representative a word is for the document's content. Another way to obtain a measure for how representative a word is for a document's content is to normalize the term-frequency (tf) by the inverse document frequency (idf). This way, we value the occurence of a word that is generally rare higher than for example the 3-times occurence of a very frequent word.\n",

While d' should be no more relevant to any query than d is, the use of the naive version of tf-idf would assign it twice as high a score as d. It might be preferable to sublinear scaling, i.e. using the logarithm of the term frequency instead of the raw term frequency, to make sure that the document's importance does not scale linearily with the term frequency.

    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- An alternative way to compute a query<>document score is to vectorize both the query and document (where each dimension corresponds to a token), and compute a score. The score can be computed using a dot product between the query and the document vectors. Why is the cosine similary function a better choice, particularly in IR? \n",
    "    - The cosine similarity between two vector representations measures similarity as the cosine of the angle between the two length-normalized vector representations. This measure is favorable compared to the naive tf-idf scores, because it disregards the magnitude of the vector difference. In contrast, it measures the difference between the relative distributions of terms in the document. If we treat a query as a short document, we can also represent it as vector and then rank the documents by cosine similarity of their vector representation to the query representation. \n",

    "- What is the time complexity of a search if we are using the vector space method mentioned in the previous question? What is the time complexity if we're using an index (assume that it fits in memory)? Assume $N$ is the number of documents and $|q|$ is the length of a query. \n",
    "     - For both searches we first have to obtain the weights for each term and document. This could be the tf-idf weights but also other measures are possible. In case of the index-based ranking, we first have to summarize the document-term scores in one score per document, which is linear in the number of documents, and then sort the scores, which has complexity $O(N \\cdot \\log{N})$ when using f.e. Timsort. This gives us a total complexity of $O(N+N \\cdot \\log{N})$. For the cosine similarity search, we have to calculate the dot product between every document vector in the collection and the vector representation of the query. This can get very expensive, considering that one cosine similarity calculation entails a dot product in the dimension of the number of different tokens in the collection (which can easily be in the ten-thousands). Furthermore, we also have to perform the sorting operation afterwards. This gives a full complexity of $O(N \\cdot T +N \\cdot \\log{N})$, where $T$ is the number of distinct tokens in the whole collection.\n",

    "- Write down the formula for computing the query likelihood, assuming a multinomial unigram language model. \n",
    "    - \\begin{align}P(Q|D)=\\prod_{i=1}^nP(q_i|D)\\end{align} where $q_i$ is a query word, and there are $n$ words in the query. The obvious choice for the language model probabilities $P(q_i|D)$ would be the maximumlikelihood estimate, i.e. \\begin{align}P(q_i|D)=\\frac{f_{q_i,D}}{|D|}\\end{align} with $f_{q_i,D}$ the count of $q_i$ in $D$ and $|D|$ the number of words in $D$.\n",
    "- What problem does this naive method have? Suggest a simple way to fix it.\n",
    "    - The problem is that as soon as any word of the query $Q$ is missing in a document $D$, the score from the query likelihood model, i.e. $P(Q|D)$, is zero. This is problemtic because especially for longer queries it is likely that the document will not contain all the query words which results in that a lot of documents will receive a relevance score of zero. Also we cannot distinguish between documents that miss different numbers of query words: e.g. the relevance score for documents missing 6 out of 7 query words will be zero, while documents missing only 1 query word will also get a score of zero. A simple way to fix this is to do smoothing: We lower the probablity estimates for words seen in the document text and then distribute the leftover probability to the words that are not present:\n",
    "    \\begin{align*}\n",
    "        (1-\\alpha_{D})P(q_i | D) + \\alpha_D P(q_i|C)\n",
    "    \\end{align*}\n",
    "    Here $\\alpha_D$ is a coefficient that controls the probability assigned to unseen words.\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\\end{align} We make use of the probability of query words in the document collection $C$, i.e.\\begin{align}P(q_i|C) = \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align}with $f_{q_i,C}$ the count of $q_i$ in the collection of all documents and $|C|$ the number of words in all documents. \n",
    "    We can now decide to set $\\alpha_D$ to a constant $0 \\geq \\lambda \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    This results in the *Jelinek-Mercer* method where the score for a query term is given by:\n",
    "    \\begin{align}P\\left(q_{i} | D\\right)=(1-\\lambda) \\frac{f_{q_{i}, D}}{|D|}+\\lambda \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align} with $\\lambda$ determining the degree of smoothing. We used this form of smoothing in our implementation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In another approach known as *Dirichlet* smoothing, $\\alpha_D$ is not just simply a constant, but is dependent on document length:\n",
    "       \\begin{align*}\n",
    "           \\alpha_D = \\frac{\\mu}{|D|+\\mu}\n",

    "    In the BM25 model, the first term is the inverse document frequency (idf) like in the tf-idf model. The difference between the models lies in the second term: As discussed earlier, longer documents tend to have higher term frequencies while not being necessarily more relevant. The tf-idf model just uses the raw term frequency (tf), whereas the BM25 model is able to normalize the tf component by the document length. The normalizing part in the tf component is $k_{1}\\left((1-b)+b \\times\\left(L_{d} / L_{\\mathrm{ave}}\\right)\\right)$ where $b$ regulates the scaling of the document lenght. So for an appropriate value of $b$, this normalization helpes to make the relevance score independent of the document length. Also for certain $k_1$, the effect of $\\mathrm{tf_{td}}$ can be made very non-linear. This gives a similar effect as the *sublinear scaling for TF* discussed previously, i.e. after the term occured a few times in the document additional occurences will have little impact on the relevance score. \n",

These labels are the gold standard or ground truth judgement assigned by human annotators (judges). However, sometimes it is hard to assess the relevance of a document relative to an information need. Take for example the query \"Paris\". Based on the query alone it is unclear whether the user is looking for the city Paris or Paris Hilton. So judges would annotate documents on the topic of city Paris and Paris Hilton both as relevant since the information need is ambiguous. In an online setting we could try to infer the information need based on additional information from for example the current search session. Based on previous searches or clicks of the user, we might find out that the user means Paris Hilton which allows us to score documents related to the city Paris as less relevant.    "
