    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Why is stemming necessary, in particular for IR?\n",
    "    - Stemming is the process of reducing inflected and derived forms of a word to a common basic form. This is done by using a set of fixed rules (for example always removing the ending -ings) and applying it to all words of all documents. This way, we can identify documents with similar content that only used different word forms. To exemplify, we can find that documents that contain the words \"democratic\", \"democracy\" or \"democratization\" are all relevant for a query that contains the word \"democrat\". This can help to increase the recall of our search.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Is there any setting (domain, scenario, etc) in which stemming can hurt performance? Illustrate with an example\n",
    "    - When we perform stemming we perform a generalisation of words, which implicitly means that we might decrease our precision. Consider for example the case that we have a query containing the word \"withing\". When our stemming algorithm removes the ending \"-ing\" whenever present, we will now find all documents that contain the word \"with\" to be relevant. Similarily, think of the words \"experiment\" and \"experience\", who might both be stemmend to \"experi\" and therefore wrongly associated."

    "- Another processing step (not done here) is to use n-grams. Illustrate why you would want to use n-grams in IR with an example.  \n",
    "    - Currently, we represent every documement as a bag-of-words which means that we completely disregard the word order. This is different when using a n-gram language model, where we represent the document as a bag of sequences of length n. By doing so, we implicitly model more context and will most likely end up with a more expressive representation of the document's content. Consequently, we can find documents that contain phrases from the query. Croft et al. give the example of the query \"black sea\". Clearly, documents that contain \"black sea\" are more likely to be relevant to our query than documents containing the words \"black\"and \"sea\" individually.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Usage of n-grams exacerbates some problems ex. in bi-gram language models. What is this problem? Suggest one solution \n",
    "    - The impact of phrases on the relevance of documents might not always be as clear as in the \"black sea\" example. For example when we consider the query \"art supplies\", a  document that does not contain the exact query but the words \"art\"/\"arts\"/\"artist\"/\"supplies\"/\"supply\"/etc. individually might be very relevant. A possible solution would be to consider both bigrams and single stemmed words contained in documents and then weight the occurences against each other to obtain an overall relevance ranking.\n",

We would have a total complexity of $O(D\\cdot n)$ where $D$ is the number of documents and $n$ is the average length of a word list associated with a document. This is because searching a list of length $n$ is in $O(n)$, assuming the list is not ordered. We have to search the token list for each document.

If we have an inverted index, the time complexity of retrieving a document list for a query is independent of the number of documents, but instead it dependents on the query length: $O(|q|)$. This reduces the time complexity since the query length is much smaller than the number of documents\n",

At retrieval time we load one index after the other and store the partial result, and then we merge all partial results together. \n",

It is helpful in finding relevant documents because it allows us to distinguish documents that focus on a specific topic from those who just briefly mention it.

This is because even after removing very common stop words like 'a'/'the'/etc. , there are still words that occur more often within written language than others. One way to deal with this problem would be to binarize the term-frequency (i.e. set 1 for occurence and 0 for non-occurence). However, this way we completely disregard how often a term occurs within a document, which is an indicator of how representative a word is for the document's content. Another way to obtain a measure for how representative a word is for a document's content is to normalize the term-frequency (tf) by the inverse document frequency (idf). This way, we value the occurence of a word that is generally rare higher than for example the 3-times occurence of a very frequent word.\n",

The score can be computed using a dot product between the query and the document vectors. Why is the cosine similary function a better choice, particularly in IR? \n",
    "    - The cosine similarity between the vector representations of two documents measure similarity as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. This measure is favorable compared to the naive tf-idf scores, because it disregards the length of the vector representation. Instead, we look at the direction of the vector representation, which is the ratio of counts of query terms in the document. This way we implicitly account for the problem descriebd in the previous question: If we just append a document to itself, the ratio between the counts of query words stays the same which means the vetor representation has the same direction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- What is the time complexity of a search if we are using the vector space method mentioned in the previous question? What is the time complexity if we're using an index (assume that it fits in memory)? Assume $N$ is the number of documents and $|q|$ is the length of a query. \n",
    "    - The time complexity is the same. In both cases we need to sort the documents based on relevance since we need to rank them. When assuming we already have the relevance scores and we use the Timsort algorithm in python, the time complexity would be  $O(n \\cdot \\log{n})$. Note that the obtaining the cosine similarity between the vectors is linear in time. "

    "#### Query Likelihood Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you will implement a simple query likelihood model. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let use implement a naive version of a QL model, assuming a multinomial unigram language model (with a uniform prior over the documents). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Make sure you use the `get_index` function to retrieve the correct index, and call `preprocess_query` with the correct index!\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Write down the formula for computing the query likelihood, assuming a multinomial unigram language model. \n",
    "    - \\begin{align}P(Q|D)=\\prod_{i=1}^nP(q_i|D)\\end{align} where $q_i$ is a query word, and there are $n$ words in the query. The obvious choice for the language model probabilities $P(q_i|D)$ would be the maximumlikelihood estimate, i.e. \\begin{align}P(q_i|D)=\\frac{f_{q_i,D}}{|D|}\\end{align} with $f_{q_i,D}$ the count of $q_i$ in $D$ and $|D|$ the number of words in $D$.\n",
    "- What problem does this naive method have? Suggest a simple way to fix it.\n",
    "    - The problem is that as soon as any word of the query $Q$ is missing in a document $D$, the score from the query likelihood model, i.e. $P(Q|D)$, is zero. This is problemtic because especially for longer queries it is likely that the document will not contain all the query words which results in that a lot of documents will receive a relevance score of zero. Also we cannot distinguish between documents that miss different numbers of query words: e.g. the relevance score for documents missing 6 out of 7 query words will be zero, while documents missing only 1 query word will also get a score of zero. A simple way to fix this is to do smoothing: We lower the probablity estimates for words seen in the document text and then distribute the leftover probability to the words that are not present:\n",
    "    \\begin{align*}\n",
    "        (1-\\alpha_{D})P(q_i | D) + \\alpha_D P(q_i|C)\n",
    "    \\end{align*}\n",
    "    Here $\\alpha_D$ is a coefficient that controls the probability assigned to unseen words.\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\\end{align} We make use of the probability of query words in the document collection $C$, i.e.\\begin{align}P(q_i|C) = \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align}with $f_{q_i,C}$ the count of $q_i$ in the collection of all documents and $|C|$ the number of words in all documents. \n",
    "    We can now decide to set $\\alpha_D$ to a constant $0 \\geq \\lambda \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    This results in the *Jelinek-Mercer* method where the score for a query term is given by:\n",
    "    \\begin{align}P\\left(q_{i} | D\\right)=(1-\\lambda) \\frac{f_{q_{i}, D}}{|D|}+\\lambda \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align} with $\\lambda$ determining the degree of smoothing. We used this form of smoothing in our implementation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In another approach known as *Dirichlet* smoothing, $\\alpha_D$ is not just simply a constant, but is dependent on document length:\n",
    "       \\begin{align*}\n",
    "           \\alpha_D = \\frac{\\mu}{|D|+\\mu}\n",
    "       \\end{align*}\n",
    "       with $\\mu$ as hyperparameter that needs to be tuned empirically.\n",

    "    Cited from Manning *et al.*: Here, $\\mathrm{tf_{td}}$ is the frequency of term $t$ in document $d$, and $\\mathrm{L_d}$ and $\\mathrm{L_{ave}}$ are the length of document $d$ and the average document length for the whole collection. The variable $\\mathrm{k_1}$ is a positive tuning parameter that calibrates the document term frequency scaling. A $\\mathrm{k_1}$ value of 0 corresponds to a binary model (no term frequency), and a large value corresponds to using raw term frequency. $b$ is another tuning parameter $(0 ≤ b ≤ 1)$ which determines the scaling by document length: $b = 1$ corresponds to fully scaling the term weight by the document length, while $b = 0$ corresponds to no length normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the BM25 model, the first term is the inverse document frequency (idf) like in the tf-idf model. The difference between the models lies in the second term: As discussed earlier, longer documents tend to have higher term frequencies while not being necessarily more relevant. The tf-idf model just uses the raw term frequency (tf), whereas the BM25 model is able to normalize the tf component by the document length. The normalizing part in the tf component is $k_{1}\\left((1-b)+b \\times\\left(L_{d} / L_{\\mathrm{ave}}\\right)\\right)$ where $b$ regulates the scaling of the document lenght. So for an appropriate value of $b$, this normalization helpes to make the relevance score independent of the document length. Also for certain $k_1$, the effect of $\\mathrm{tf_{td}}$ can be made very non-linear. This gives a similar effect as the *sublinear scaling for TF* discussed previously, i.e. after the term occured a few times in the document additional occurences will have little impact on the relevance score. \n",

These labels are the gold standard or ground truth judgement assigned by human annotators (judges). However, sometimes it is hard to assess the relevance of a document relative to an information need. Take for example the query \"Paris\". Based on the query alone it is unclear whether the user is looking for the city Paris or Paris Hilton. So judges would annotate documents on the topic of city Paris and Paris Hilton both as relevant since the information need is ambiguous. In an online setting we could try to infer the information need based on additional information from for example the current search session. Based on previous searches or clicks of the user, we might find out that the user means Paris Hilton which allows us to score documents related to the city Paris as less relevant.    "
