    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Why is stemming necessary, in particular for IR?\n",
    "    - Stemming is the process of reducing inflected and derived forms of a word to a common basic form. This is done by using a set of fixed rules (for example always removing the ending -ings) and applying it to all words of all documents. This way, we can identify documents with similar content that only used different word forms. To exemplify, we can find that documents that contain the words \"democratic\", \"democracy\" or \"democratization\" are all relevant for a query that contains the word \"democrat\". This can help to increase the recall of our search.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Is there any setting (domain, scenario, etc) in which stemming can hurt performance? Illustrate with an example\n",
    "    - When we perform stemming we perform a generalisation of words, which implicitly means that we might decrease our precision. Consider for example the case that we have a query containing the word \"withing\". When our stemming algorithm removes the ending \"-ing\" whenever present, we will now find all documents that contain the word \"with\" to be relevant. Similarily, think of the words \"experiment\" and \"experience\", who might both be stemmend to \"experi\" and therefore wrongly associated."

    "- Another processing step (not done here) is to use n-grams. Illustrate why you would want to use n-grams in IR with an example.  \n",
    "    - Currently, we represent every documement as a bag-of-words which means that we completely disregard the word order. This is different when using a n-gram language model, where we represent the document as a bag of sequences of length n. By doing so, we implicitly model more context and will most likely end up with a more expressive representation of the document's content. Consequently, we can find documents that contain phrases from the query. Croft et al. give the example of the query \"black sea\". Clearly, documents that contain \"black sea\" are more likely to be relevant to our query than documents containing the words \"black\"and \"sea\" individually.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Usage of n-grams exacerbates some problems ex. in bi-gram language models. What is this problem? Suggest one solution \n",
    "    - The impact of phrases on the relevance of documents might not always be as clear as in the \"black sea\" example. For example when we consider the query \"art supplies\", a  document that does not contain the exact query but the words \"art\"/\"arts\"/\"artist\"/\"supplies\"/\"supply\"/etc. individually might be very relevant. A possible solution would be to consider both bigrams and single stemmed words contained in documents and then weight the occurences against each other to obtain an overall relevance ranking.\n",

We would have a total complexity of $O(D\\cdot n)$ where $D$ is the number of documents and $n$ is the average length of a word list associated with a document. This is because searching a list of length $n$ is in $O(n)$, assuming the list is not ordered. We have to search the token list for each document.  Note that the average runtime of this could be reduced in practice if the list of words associated with a document was in alphabetical order.\n",

If we have an inverted index, the time complexity of retrieving a document list for a query is independent of the number of documents, but instead it dependents on the query length: $O(|q|)$. This reduces the time complexity since the query length is much smaller than the number of documents\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - If the inverted index is too big for our runtime memory, we can make use of merging. Instead of having one index, we write multiple partial indices to the disk. At retrieval time we load one index after the other and store the partial result, and then we merge all partial results together. \n",

This is because even after removing very common stop words like 'a'/'the'/etc. , there are still words that occur more often within written language than others. One way to deal with this problem would be to binarize the term-frequency (i.e. set 1 for occurence and 0 for non-occurence). However, this way we completely disregard how often a term occurs within a document, which is an indicator of how representative a word is for the document's content. Another way to obtain a measure for how representative a word is for a document's content is to normalize the term-frequency (tf) by the inverse document frequency (idf). This way, we value the occurence of a word that is generally rare higher than for example the 3-times occurence of a very frequent word.\n",

While d ′ should be no more relevant to any query than d is, the use of the naive version of tf-idf would assign it twice as high a score as d. SEPIR book:A document collection can contain documents of many different lengths. Although normalization accounts for this to some degree, long documents can have many terms occurring once and others occurring hundreds of times. Retrieval experiments have shown that to reduce the impact of these frequent terms, it is effective to use the logarithm of the number of term occurrences in tf weights rather than the raw count (which is what sublinear scaling for TF does). \n",

The obvious choice for the language model probabilities $P(q_i|D)$ would be the maximumlikelihood estimate, i.e. \\begin{align}P(q_i|D)=\\frac{f_{q_i,D}}{|D|}\\end{align} with $f_{q_i,D}$ the count of $q_i$ in $D$ and $|D|$ the number of words in $D$.\n",

    "    - The problem is that as soon as any word of the query $Q$ is missing in a document $D$, the score from the query likelihood model, i.e. $P(Q|D)$, is zero. This is problemtic because for longer queries we will receive a lot of zero scores and also we cannot distinguish between documents that miss different numbers of query words. A simple way to fix this is to do smoothing: We lower the score for words seen in the document text and then distribute the leftover probability to the words that are not present. \\begin{align}\\end{align} We make use of the probability of query words in the document collection $C$, i.e.\\begin{align}P(q_i|C) = \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align}with $f_{q_i,C}$ the count of $q_i$ in all documents and $|C|$ the number of words in all documents. The score for a query term then is \\begin{align}P\\left(q_{i} | D\\right)=(1-\\lambda) \\frac{f_{q_{i}, D}}{|D|}+\\lambda \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align} where $\\lambda$ is between 0 and 1."
