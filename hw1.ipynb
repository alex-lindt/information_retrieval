    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Why is stemming necessary, in particular for IR?\n",
    "    - Stemming is the process of reducing inflected and derived forms of a word to a common basic form. This is done by using a set of fixed rules (for example always removing the ending -ings) and applying it to all words of all documents. This way, we can identify documents with similar content that only used different word forms. To exemplify, we can find that documents that contain the words \"democratic\", \"democracy\" or \"democratization\" are all relevant for a query that contains the word \"democrat\". This can help to increase the recall of our search.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Is there any setting (domain, scenario, etc) in which stemming can hurt performance? Illustrate with an example\n",
    "    - When we perform stemming we perform a generalisation of words, which implicitly means that we might decrease our precision. Consider for example the case that we have a query containing the word \"withing\". When our stemming algorithm removes the ending \"-ing\" whenever present, we will now find all documents that contain the word \"with\" to be relevant. Similarily, think of the words \"experiment\" and \"experience\", who might both be stemmend to \"experi\" and therefore wrongly associated."

    "- Another processing step (not done here) is to use n-grams. Illustrate why you would want to use n-grams in IR with an example.  \n",
    "    - Currently, we represent every documement as a bag-of-words which means that we completely disregard the word order. This is different when using a n-gram language model, where we represent the document as a bag of sequences of length n. By doing so, we implicitly model more context and will most likely end up with a more expressive representation of the document's content. Consequently, we can find documents that contain phrases from the query. Croft et al. give the example of the query \"black sea\". Clearly, documents that contain \"black sea\" are more likely to be relevant to our query than documents containing the words \"black\"and \"sea\" individually.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- Usage of n-grams exacerbates some problems ex. in bi-gram language models. What is this problem? Suggest one solution \n",
    "    - The impact of phrases on the relevance of documents might not always be as clear as in the \"black sea\" example. For example when we consider the query \"art supplies\", a  document that does not contain the exact query but the words \"art\"/\"arts\"/\"artist\"/\"supplies\"/\"supply\"/etc. individually might be very relevant. A possible solution would be to consider both bigrams and single words contained in documents and then weight the occurences against each other to obtain an overall relevance ranking.\n",
