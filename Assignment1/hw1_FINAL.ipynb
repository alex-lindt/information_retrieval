    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- Why is stemming necessary, in particular for IR?\n",
    "    - Stemming is the process of reducing inflected and derived forms of a word to a common basic form. This is done by using a set of fixed rules (for example always removing the ending -ings) and applying it to all words of all documents. This way, we can identify documents with similar content that only used different word forms. To exemplify, we can find that documents that contain the words \"democratic\", \"democracy\" or \"democratization\" are all relevant for a query that contains the word \"democrat\". This can help to increase the recall of our search.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Is there any setting (domain, scenario, etc) in which stemming can hurt performance? Illustrate with an example\n",
    "    - When we perform stemming we perform a generalisation of words, which implicitly means that we might decrease our precision. Consider for example the case that we have a query containing the word \"withing\". When our stemming algorithm removes the ending \"-ing\" whenever present, we will now find all documents that contain the word \"with\" to be relevant. Similarily, think of the words \"experiment\" and \"experience\", who might both be stemmend to \"experi\" and therefore wrongly associated."

    "- Another processing step (not done here) is to use n-grams. Illustrate why you would want to use n-grams in IR with an example.  \n",
    "    - Currently, we represent every documement as a bag-of-words which means that we completely disregard the word order. This is different when using a n-gram language model, where we represent the document as a bag of sequences of length n. By doing so, we implicitly model more context and will most likely end up with a more expressive representation of the document's content. Consequently, we can find documents that contain phrases from the query. Croft et al. give the example of the query \"black sea\". Clearly, documents that contain \"black sea\" are more likely to be relevant to our query than documents containing the words \"black\"and \"sea\" individually.\n",

    "    Assuming the dictionary is maps from document id to tokens in the document, we have to access the dictionary multiple times. We would have a total complexity of $O(D\\cdot n)$ where $D$ is the number of documents and $n$ is the average length of a word list associated with a document. This is because searching a list of length $n$ is in $O(n)$, assuming the list is not ordered. We have to search the token list for each document.  Note that the average runtime of this could be reduced in practice if the list of words associated with a document was in alphabetical order.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - If we have an inverted index, the time complexity of retrieving a document list for a query is independent of the number of documents, but instead it dependents on the query length. We would need to access the index dictionary $|q|$ times, i.e. we have $O(|q|)$ (note that we do not account here for having to calculate the intersection between all retrieved document id lists). This reduces the time complexity compared to the {document-> token} dictonary a lot, since the query length is usually much smaller than the number of documents.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- For a large enough collection, we cannot store an index in memory. How is this tackled in practice (briefly explain)? Comment on the time complexity. \n",
    "    - If the inverted index is too big for our runtime memory, we can make use of merging. Instead of having one index, we write multiple partial indices to the disk. At retrieval time we load one index after the other and store the partial result, and then we merge all partial results together. Regarding time complexity, this does only add a merging operation in the end, which can happen in $O($*total number of retrived document ids*$)$ using the python *set* function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Mention a use-case in which a simple index (from word -> doc_id) might not suffice anymore. How would you modify the index to suit this use-case (if you can!)  \n",
    "    - An example information that could be stored in the posting next to the document ID is the word count. It is helpful in finding relevant documents because it allows us to distinguish documents that focus on a specific topic from those who just briefly mention it. As an example, we can think of the query \"Spaghetti Carbonara\". A document that describes how to make the dish is very likely to repeat both words multiple times whereas some document about planning your vacation in Italy might address in one sentence a restaurant where a nice Spaghetti Carbonara can be found.

This is because even after removing very common stop words like 'a'/'the'/etc. , there are still words that occur more often within written language than others. One way to deal with this problem would be to binarize the term-frequency (i.e. set 1 for occurence and 0 for non-occurence). However, this way we completely disregard how often a term occurs within a document, which is an indicator of how representative a word is for the document's content. Another way to obtain a measure for how representative a word is for a document's content is to normalize the term-frequency (tf) by the inverse document frequency (idf). This way, we value the occurence of a word that is generally rare higher than for example the 3-times occurence of a very frequent word.\n",

    "    - Using the naive version of tf-idf the importance of the document scales linearly with the number of term occurences. This means that we will generally consider longer documents to be more relevant because they tend to repeat the same words multiple times.\n",

    "    - Consider the following extreme example: suppose we were to take a document d and create a new document d' by simply appending a copy of d to itself. While d' should be no more relevant to any query than d is, the use of the naive version of tf-idf would assign it twice as high a score as d. It might be preferable to sublinear scaling, i.e. using the logarithm of the term frequency instead of the raw term frequency, to make sure that the document's importance does not scale linearily with the term frequency. In the given example, this would mean that if the relevance of document d would be 1, the relevance of d' would be log(2) instead of 2."

    "- An alternative way to compute a query<>document score is to vectorize both the query and document (where each dimension corresponds to a token), and compute a score. The score can be computed using a dot product between the query and the document vectors. Why is the cosine similary function a better choice, particularly in IR? \n",
    "    - The cosine similarity between two vector representations measures similarity as the cosine of the angle between the two length-normalized vector representations. This measure is favorable compared to the naive tf-idf scores, because it disregards the magnitude of the vector difference. In contrast, it measures the difference between the relative distributions of terms in the document. If we treat a query as a short document, we can also represent it as vector and then rank the documents by cosine similarity of their vector representation to the query representation. \n",

    "     - For both searches we first have to obtain the weights for each term and document. This could be the tf-idf weights but also other measures are possible. In case of the index-based ranking, we first have to summarize the document-term scores in one score per document, which is linear in the number of documents, and then sort the scores, which has complexity $O(N \\cdot \\log{N})$ when using f.e. Timsort. This gives us a total complexity of $O(N+N \\cdot \\log{N})$. For the cosine similarity search, we have to calculate the dot product between every document vector in the collection and the vector representation of the query. This can get very expensive, considering that one cosine similarity calculation entails a dot product in the dimension of the number of different tokens in the collection (which can easily be in the ten-thousands). Furthermore, we also have to perform the sorting operation afterwards. This gives a full complexity of $O(N \\cdot T +N \\cdot \\log{N})$, where $T$ is the number of distinct tokens in the whole collection.\n",

    "- Write down the formula for computing the query likelihood, assuming a multinomial unigram language model. \n",
    "    - \\begin{align}P(Q|D)=\\prod_{i=1}^nP(q_i|D)\\end{align} where $q_i$ is a query word, and there are $n$ words in the query. The obvious choice for the language model probabilities $P(q_i|D)$ would be the maximumlikelihood estimate, i.e. \\begin{align}P(q_i|D)=\\frac{f_{q_i,D}}{|D|}\\end{align} with $f_{q_i,D}$ the count of $q_i$ in $D$ and $|D|$ the number of words in $D$.\n",
    "- What problem does this naive method have? Suggest a simple way to fix it.\n",
    "    - The problem is that as soon as any word of the query $Q$ is missing in a document $D$, the score from the query likelihood model, i.e. $P(Q|D)$, is zero. This is problemtic because especially for longer queries it is likely that the document will not contain all the query words which results in that a lot of documents will receive a relevance score of zero. Also we cannot distinguish between documents that miss different numbers of query words: e.g. the relevance score for documents missing 6 out of 7 query words will be zero, while documents missing only 1 query word will also get a score of zero. A simple way to fix this is to do smoothing: We lower the probablity estimates for words seen in the document text and then distribute the leftover probability to the words that are not present:\n",
    "    \\begin{align*}\n",
    "        (1-\\alpha_{D})P(q_i | D) + \\alpha_D P(q_i|C)\n",
    "    \\end{align*}\n",
    "    Here $\\alpha_D$ is a coefficient that controls the probability assigned to unseen words.\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\\end{align} We make use of the probability of query words in the document collection $C$, i.e.\\begin{align}P(q_i|C) = \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align}with $f_{q_i,C}$ the count of $q_i$ in the collection of all documents and $|C|$ the number of words in all documents. \n",
    "    We can now decide to set $\\alpha_D$ to a constant $0 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 1$.\n",
    "    This results in the *Jelinek-Mercer* method where the score for a query term is given by:\n",
    "    \\begin{align}P\\left(q_{i} | D\\right)=(1-\\lambda) \\frac{f_{q_{i}, D}}{|D|}+\\lambda \\frac{f_{q_i,C}}{|C|} \\end{align} with $\\lambda$ determining the degree of smoothing. We used this form of smoothing in our implementation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In another approach known as *Dirichlet* smoothing, $\\alpha_D$ is not just simply a constant, but is dependent on document length:\n",
    "       \\begin{align*}\n",
    "           \\alpha_D = \\frac{\\mu}{|D|+\\mu}\n",

    "    \\sum_{t \\in q} \\log \\left[\\frac{N}{\\mathrm{df}_{t}}\\right] \\cdot \\frac{\\left(k_{1}+1\\right) \\mathrm{tf}_{t d}}{k_{1}\\left((1-b)+b \\times\\left(L_{d} / L_{\\mathrm{ave}}\\right)\\right)+\\mathrm{tf}_{t d}}\n",

    "    Cited from Manning *et al.*: Here, $\\mathrm{tf_{td}}$ is the frequency of term $t$ in document $d$, and $\\mathrm{L_d}$ and $\\mathrm{L_{ave}}$ are the length of document $d$ and the average document length for the whole collection. The variable $\\mathrm{k_1}$ is a positive tuning parameter that calibrates the document term frequency scaling. A $\\mathrm{k_1}$ value of 0 corresponds to a binary model (no term frequency), and a large value corresponds to using raw term frequency. $b$ is another tuning parameter $(0 ≤ b ≤ 1)$ which determines the scaling by document length: $b = 1$ corresponds to fully scaling the term weight by the document length, while $b = 0$ corresponds to no length normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the BM25 model, the first term is the inverse document frequency (idf) like in the tf-idf model. The difference between the models lies in the second term: As discussed earlier, longer documents tend to have higher term frequencies while not being necessarily more relevant. The tf-idf model just uses the raw term frequency (tf), whereas the BM25 model is able to normalize the tf component by the document length. The normalizing part in the tf component is $k_{1}\\left((1-b)+b \\times\\left(L_{d} / L_{\\mathrm{ave}}\\right)\\right)$ where $b$ regulates the scaling of the document lenght. So for an appropriate value of $b$, this normalization helpes to make the relevance score independent of the document length. Also for certain $k_1$, the effect of $\\mathrm{tf_{td}}$ can be made very non-linear. This gives a similar effect as the *sublinear scaling for TF* discussed previously, i.e. after the term occured a few times in the document additional occurences will have little impact on the relevance score. \n",

These labels are the gold standard or ground truth judgement assigned by human annotators (judges). However, sometimes it is hard to assess the relevance of a document relative to an information need. Take for example the query \"Paris\". Based on the query alone it is unclear whether the user is looking for the city Paris or Paris Hilton. So judges would annotate documents on the topic of city Paris and Paris Hilton both as relevant since the information need is ambiguous. In an online setting we could try to infer the information need based on additional information from for example the current search session. Based on previous searches or clicks of the user, we might find out that the user means Paris Hilton which allows us to score documents related to the city Paris as less relevant.    "

    "*Answer the following questions*: \n",
    "- What are the main drawbacks of precision & recall?\n",
    "    - * Precision and recall are traditional evaluation measures where we treat the relevance as a binary classification problem. If we want to use recall and precision to evaluate the output of our retrieval model, we could calcuate precision and recall scores at every ranking. However, it is inconvenient and redundant to this for the large set of retrieved documents assuming that the user will only examine the top-K results. Therefore we could calculate recall and precision only for the top-K documents, i.e. we choose K as a cut-off point. Whereas Precision@K and Recall@K are easy to compute and to interpret, there are three main drawbacks:\n",
    "        - The value of K has a huge impact on the metric\n",
    "        - The ranking of documents withing the top K is inconsequential \n",
    "        - How do we pick a value for K?\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "         \n",
    "- What problems with Precision@K does Average Precision solve? \n",
    "    -    With Average Precision we don't have to pick a cut-off K. \n",
    "         Average precision is calculated using only the ranking of retrieved relevant documents, resulting in a single value that strongly depends on the highly ranked relevant documents; the lower a relevant document is ranked, the less it will affect the average precision value. In this way, the measure is able to take into account that as many relevant documents as possible should be retrieved and that the most relevant documents should be ranked on top [Croft et al.].\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CACM dataset has *binary* relevance judgements. However, a more suitable way of assigning judgements is to use graded relevance. Mention a metric which might be more suitable for a graded relevance, and breifly explain why. \n",
    "    - A metric that is more suitable for graded relevance is discounted cumulative gain (DCG). This metric is based on the following two assumptions [Croft et al.]: Highly relevant documents are more useful than marginally relevant document (i.e. relevance of a document will not degrade if there is already another relevant document retrieved with exactly the same information). The lower a relevant document is ranked in the list, the less useful it is for the user, because it is less likely to be examined. Graded relevance is used as a measure of the usefulness, or gain from examining a document, rather than treating it as a binary classification task.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Consider a text processing step: stemming. What effect does this have on metrics? (Hint: Try changing the pre-processing config and try it out!)\n",
    "    - If we do stemming in our text processing, term frequency counts in documents will go up. This causes the relevance score to be less accumulated on the top ranked documents but slightly more distributed.\n",
    "\n",

    "The first thing to notice here is that using index set 2 is highly benefecial for the performance of all ranking algorithms. This makes sense, considering that in index set 1 we neither stemmed nor removed stop words, which means we cannot find relations between words of the same word stem and also give a big importance to high frequent fill words that are not elevant to the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the ranking methods, Naive QL performed the worst. This makes sense when we consider that our test queries were quite long, therefore it is unlikely for a document to contain all query words and a lot of actually relevant documents get a score of 0. QL clearly outperformed Naive QL in all metrics, which is what we expected. However, compared to the simple methods tf-idf and BOW, QL had a similar precision and even a lower recall, ERR and MAP. This came as a surprise, because QL seemed to be a more sophisticated method than BOW and tf-idf by definition. We cannot really explain this to ourselves, maybe we should have experimented with different hyperparameters more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, BM25 was our winning ranking algorithm across all metrics. This comes as no surprise when we consider that tf-idf already performs pretty well and BM25 extends tf-idf and makes it more independent of document-length and uneven term frequencies.\n"
